Booking Options: You can book your stay directly via the Planet Hollywood official website or call center – this site often offers packages (e.g. stay + airfare) and special promotions​

​

. Since Planet Hollywood Cancun is part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection, you can also book through Marriott Bonvoy channels​

. Marriott Bonvoy members earn points on qualifying rates and can redeem points for stays here​

. (Note: some of the larger multi-room suites or special occupancy arrangements can only be booked on the Planet Hollywood site due to technical limitations on Marriott’s system​

.) Additionally, the resort is offered by major travel agencies and booking platforms (Expedia, Booking.com, Costco Travel, etc.), which may have bundled deals. Always enter the correct number of guests (including children and their ages) when booking, as the all-inclusive rate is based on occupancy and age – extra adult or child fees will apply if you show up with more people than reserved​

​

.

Resort Policies
Check-In/Check-Out: Standard check-in time is 3:00 PM and check-out time is 12:00 PM (noon)​

​

. The resort will accommodate early check-in or late check-out if possible, but it’s subject to availability. For convenience, they offer an online pre check-in option prior to arrival​

, which can speed up the process at the front desk. A valid credit card is required at check-in for incidentals and verification.
Cancellation Policy: Cancellation terms vary with the booking rate and season. Generally, you will be presented with specific cancellation deadlines (e.g. up to 7 or 14 days before arrival for a full refund) at the time of booking, and these will be confirmed in your reservation details​

. Failure to cancel in time or no-shows typically incur a penalty (often one night’s stay or a certain percentage, depending on the offer)​

. For non-refundable advance purchase rates, no cancellation is allowed without charge. It’s important to review the cancellation policy on your confirmation and contact the resort or your booking provider if you need to make changes.
Resort Fees & Taxes: Planet Hollywood Cancun does not charge a separate resort fee – all the standard inclusions (meals, most activities, Wi-Fi, etc.) are covered in the all-inclusive rate​

. However, as with all hotels in the region, an environmental sanitation tax is collected at check-in: currently about MXN 32 (≈ $2 USD) per person, per night​

. This is a local government fee in Quintana Roo. Additionally, all prices and bills will have the necessary 16% VAT and 3% lodging tax included or added as required (usually included in package prices). Tipping for good service is optional but appreciated (tips are not compulsory in all-inclusive plans, but many guests do tip staff for exceptional service).
Identification and Age Requirements: A government-issued photo ID (passport for international guests) and a credit card are required at check-in. The minimum check-in age is 18 years old​

. Guests under 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. The resort is family-friendly, so children of all ages are welcome (with ages 0–1 considered infants free of charge, 2–12 considered children, 13–17 charged as teenagers at a reduced rate)​

. Those booked in the Adult Scene section must be 18 or older.
All-Inclusive Inclusions: The all-inclusive package covers unlimited dining and drinks at all restaurants and bars, 24-hour room service, daily activities, nightly entertainment, use of the fitness center, kids club, and non-motorized water sports (kayaks, snorkel gear, etc.)​

​

. Not included are spa treatments, motorized water sports, the FlowRider, Planet Play, and off-site tours (these come with additional charges as noted with a ($) symbol on resort materials). If you upgrade to STAR Class, additional services are included (as described above).
Other Policies: Pets are not allowed at this resort (with the exception of service animals)​

. The property is non-smoking in indoor areas and rooms; there are designated smoking areas outdoors for guests who need them. Accessibility: The resort is equipped with elevators and has accessible rooms and routes for guests with disabilities (e.g. ramps to common areas, wheelchair-accessible rooms and bathrooms available)​

​

 – if you have special needs, inform the resort in advance. Wristbands: Upon check-in you’ll receive a resort wristband (which acts as your room key and all-inclusive ID), and replacement fees may apply if lost. Finally, the resort enforces a reasonable quiet hours policy after midnight; however, some noise can carry from late-night venues, so guests who are light sleepers may request rooms away from the main entertainment hubs.
Guest Reviews & Feedback
To get a balanced view, we’ve summarized common themes from guest reviews:

What Guests Love: Many visitors rave about the abundance of activities and facilities for all ages. The multiple pools and the beautiful white-sand beach (notably free of excessive seaweed) are frequently mentioned as highlights​

​

. Guests traveling with family appreciate the entertainment options like the kids splash parks, lazy river, and the movie theater. Food quality generally meets or exceeds expectations for an all-inclusive – the extensive breakfast buffet is a hit​

, and specific venues like Guy’s Burger Joint often earn praise for delicious bites​

. Another highlight is the resort’s ambiance; despite its star-studded theme, the vibe is “everyone is welcome” – it manages to be both family-friendly and party-friendly in different zones​

. The property itself is described as new, clean, and visually stunning, with modern design and fun movie memorabilia at every turn​

. Guests also often commend the hard-working, friendly staff, noting that bartenders and entertainment staff in particular go above and beyond to ensure everyone is having a great time​

.
Standout Favorites: According to guest feedback, some of the most recommended features include the lazy river with swim-up bar, the evening shows and themed parties (which are high-energy and engaging), and the STAR Class upgrade for those who tried it – STAR Class guests enjoyed the private pool/bar and felt the personal concierge service added convenience to their stay​

​

. The beach area also gets a special mention: it’s in the relatively secluded Costa Mujeres area, meaning the beach is wide, tranquil, and “absolutely beautiful” with powdery sand​

. Guests who ventured to the spa reported very relaxing treatments and loved the hydrotherapy circuit (which STAR Class includes for free) as a cool perk.
Common Complaints: The most frequent criticism is about the dining reservation system (or lack thereof) for the à la carte restaurants. During peak seasons, wait times can be long for dinner if you’re not a STAR Class member. Guests have reported wait-list pager times of 1–2+ hours for popular restaurants unless you dine very early​

. This has been frustrating for some, especially hungry families. Another commonly cited issue is the check-in process, which some found disorganized or slow on busy days​

. A few reviews mention that information about resort activities or how to make reservations wasn’t proactively given, leaving guests to figure things out on their own​

. Additionally, while many praise the staff, a number of guests felt service could be hit-or-miss – for example, some STAR Class guests did not find their butler (personal agent) very responsive​

, and a handful of staff were described as overly pushy in seeking positive TripAdvisor reviews​

. Another challenge during high occupancy is crowding at the pools and amenities: getting a poolside lounger can be tough unless you reserve one early (chair-saving is common) or tip the pool attendants​

. Noise was a concern for a few guests; because the resort has a vibrant atmosphere, rooms near the central courtyard or main pool might hear music and activity into the night (sometimes until midnight)​

. Lastly, the resort’s location, while beautifully secluded, is farther from the airport and city – some noted the 45-minute drive from Cancun Airport and that off-site taxis or trips to the Hotel Zone can be pricey (approx $50–$60 USD each way)​

.
Management Responses & Solutions: The resort management has acknowledged peak-time dining issues and in practice they allow STAR Class guests to make advance dinner reservations through their personal agents, which alleviates waits for those guests​

. For other guests, a useful strategy is to dine early or late (e.g. be at the restaurant right at opening) to avoid the rush​

. Utilizing the buffet (which has wide variety and no wait) is a no-hassle alternative on nights you don’t want to wait. There is also a 24-hour room service included, which some guests use if restaurants are full. To streamline arrival, the resort encourages the online pre-check-in and provides a separate line for STAR Class check-in in the lounge, which can reduce waiting​

. Once checked in, using the Planet Hollywood mobile app or the info channel on the room TV is highly recommended – it contains schedules for activities, restaurant hours, and maps​

, helping guests plan their days without missing out. For the pool chair issue, management has pool concierges to help find seating; tipping a staff member to secure a spot or renting a cabana for guaranteed space are ways guests have worked around this​

. If noise is a concern, guests can request rooms that are farther from the main nightlife areas – for example, rooms in buildings nearer to the beach tend to be quieter at night. Also, those seeking a more peaceful experience can consider booking the Adult Scene wing, which is smaller, adults-only, and comes with its own pool and restaurant, resulting in a calmer environment while still allowing access to all main resort amenities​

​

. Overall, while there are some growing pains and peak-time pressures (the resort opened in 2021 and quickly became popular), management and staff do try to address issues brought to their attention – many guests who encountered problems noted that issues were resolved after speaking to a manager or their personal agent.
Activities and Nearby Attractions
One of Planet Hollywood Cancun’s strengths is the variety of activities available on-site, as well as the opportunities for adventure in the surrounding region:

On-Site Daily Activities: Each day is filled with options. The entertainment team leads pool games, fitness classes (like beach yoga and Zumba), trivia contests, and dance lessons. You can participate in beach volleyball, water polo, or try the climbing wall (if available) by the activity pool. The resort’s event schedule often includes special theme nights – e.g. Hollywood movie trivia nights, karaoke, or live music at the lobby bar. Kids have their own schedule at the Stars Kids Club (treasure hunts, science experiments, talent shows, etc.), while teens might enjoy organized basketball games or dance parties. There’s also an on-site tennis court and half-court basketball, plus the mini-golf course, which families often play in the afternoons.

Nightly Entertainment: Come evening, professional shows are hosted in the resort’s theater or outdoor plaza – these might be musical performances, magic shows, or movie-inspired stage shows. For example, guests have enjoyed Hollywood-themed dance revues and acrobatic shows after dinner. The resort’s nightclub (Twist Social Bar) and the sports bar keep things lively until midnight or later, with DJs, live bands on select nights, and big screens for events​

. There’s also the on-site disco which sometimes has themed costume nights (perfect for unleashing your inner star!). If you prefer a low-key night, the beach bar and lobby bar offer laid-back environments to sip a cocktail under the stars.

Unique Attractions: In addition to the previously mentioned amenities (FlowRider, trampoline park, etc.), Planet Hollywood Cancun has some unique star-worthy attractions:

Hollywood Fast Drivers: an adrenaline-pumping go-kart experience where you can race in a custom 1930s hot rod or a classic Shelby Cobra on a controlled track​

. This thrilling ride goes 0–100 km/h (62mph) in just seconds, giving you a taste of action-movie driving (available at an extra cost)​

.
Planet Play arcade and trampoline zone: features trampolines to jump on, an indoor glow-in-the-dark mini-golf, racing simulators, and classic arcade games (open late into the evening, with an entry fee or pay-per-play)​

.
Starlets & Strollers program: For families with infants, the resort can provide complimentary baby amenities like strollers, cribs, baby baths, and bottle sterilizers upon request (limited availability) – making travel with little ones easier. Babysitting services are also offered (for a fee) if parents want a night out.
Water Sports: The resort sits on a calm stretch of beach in Costa Mujeres, which is great for swimming and non-motorized water sports. Guests can check out kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, or snorkel gear from the beach shack (subject to weather and availability)​

. Introductory scuba diving lessons in the pool are sometimes offered. For an additional fee, you can book scuba excursions, deep-sea fishing, or jet-ski rentals through the tour desk on site.

Off-Site Excursions: Cancun and the Riviera Maya are rich with attractions, and the resort’s Planet Hollywood Experiences desk (operated by Nexus Tours) can help you arrange a variety of excursions​

​

. Popular options include:

Isla Mujeres: A short boat ride away, this charming island makes for a perfect day trip. The concierge can book a catamaran sailing to Isla Mujeres – you’ll cruise the turquoise waters, perhaps do some snorkeling on the way, and then relax on Isla’s famous Playa Norte beach or explore the colorful downtown streets​

. Catamaran tours often include open bar and lunch. If you prefer to go on your own, the public ferry at Punta Sam (about a 5-10 minute drive from the resort) will take you to Isla Mujeres in about 20 minutes.
Mayan Ruins & History: History buffs can visit Chichén Itzá, the famous UNESCO World Heritage site with its iconic pyramid, on a full-day tour (about 2.5 hours away). Closer by is Tulum, the postcard-perfect cliffside ruins overlooking the sea (around 1.5 hours south)​

. Many tours to these ruins also include a stop at a cenote (natural sinkhole pool) for a refreshing swim in crystal-clear water​

.
Eco-Adventures: The Riviera Maya boasts several eco-adventure parks. Excursions to Xcaret, Xel-Há, or Xplor can be arranged, where you can snorkel in lagoons, river-tube through caves, zip-line, and see wildlife. There’s also Xavage Park for extreme activities like off-road driving and rafting​

. These parks are full-day experiences with lots of included activities and shows (fun for families and thrill-seekers).
Other Activities: You can join a pirate-themed dinner cruise on a galleon in the Cancun marina – a popular evening excursion for families (with fireworks and pirate shows)​

. Dolphin encounter programs are available at nearby facilities (like Dolphin Discovery on Isla Mujeres or in Puerto Cancun). For adults, guided nightlife tours to Cancun’s famous clubs (Coco Bongo, etc.) can be booked with transportation so you can enjoy the party scene worry-free.
The resort’s tour desk will provide transportation for excursions if not included, and many tours pick up directly from the hotel lobby. It’s recommended to book through the official desk to ensure quality and safety – plus, private tours or custom trips (for example, hiring a van to explore on your own) can also be arranged.

Nearby Points of Interest: Planet Hollywood is in the Costa Mujeres/Playa Mujeres area, which is a newer resort enclave north of Cancun’s main Hotel Zone. Apart from other resorts and the golf course nearby, the area is mostly tranquil. If you venture out independently, Downtown Cancun (El Centro) is about a 30-minute drive south, where you can find local restaurants, shopping malls, and markets (like Mercado 28 for souvenirs). Puerto Juarez (20 minutes away) is where another ferry terminal to Isla Mujeres is located if you miss the one at Punta Sam. For golfers, the Playa Mujeres Golf Club, an 18-hole course designed by Greg Norman, is in the same general area (a short drive from the resort) and offers a lush course with ocean views. Guests looking for additional shopping or nightlife can head to Cancun’s Hotel Zone (about 40–50 minutes by car); however, most find that the resort itself provides plenty to do for the duration of their stay.
